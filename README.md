## Dynamic Schema based Form Generation
This is a schema based form generation app, there are 3 form objects i've setup to demo the dynamic generation of forms through the Form component which taskes a schema as a prop.

## Rendering different forms
Switch out the schema object currently set to 'signUp' with the other imported objects from the formOptions file. for example mailingList or Feedback form.

### To Get up and running
Start the app by running yarn start or npm start

### Form Schema
Form Schema is configured in the libs/formOptions file. Here

### Visual Libraries used
The package I used for the UI: Material UI core
